Before you do any of these you must be familiar with

-installing and using citus(postgress), there are other alternatives but for this project we used citus
-installing express 
-installing and running react and nodejs

for all the above mentioned you can google or just ask chatgpt on how to install and run them

Bear in mind that this project was mostly focused on database interaction with the user hence we basically focused more on functionality but we will be back to fix the gui once done with exams
